## Reporting a Vulnerability

While this is a personal learning project, if you discover a security vulnerability in any of the code, I would appreciate it if you could bring it to my attention.

Please report vulnerabilities by opening a new issue on the repository. Please provide as much detail as possible in your report, including the steps to reproduce the vulnerability.

Thank you for helping to improve the quality of my work.
