# C Programming Exercises: Tution Collection ðŸ“š

This repository contains a collection of C programs, organized by their source of origin from my tuition and lab classes. The aim is to create a clear and well-documented archive of all my work for easy reference.

## Project Overview

This folder serves as a centralized hub for all my C programming exercises. The files are meticulously named using a specific prefix to easily identify their source, as detailed in the section below.

## File Naming Convention

Each C source file (`.c`) follows a clear prefix system to indicate its origin. A quick glance at the filename tells you which class or lab session the code belongs to.

| Prefix | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`APC-S`** | Programs from class sessions with Soumi Madam. | Soumi Madam's Class |
| **`APC-SPS`** | Programs from class sessions with SPS Sir. | SPS Sir's Class |
| **`APC-PRAC`** | Programs completed during practical lab sessions. | Lab Practical |
| **`P`** | Programs from private tuition classes at Eduincs. | Eduincs (Private Tuition) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a C compiler installed on your system to compile and run these programs. **[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)** is highly recommended.

### How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any C program in this directory, follow these simple steps using your terminal:

1.  **Navigate to the `tution-c` folder:**
    ```bash
    cd tution-c
    ```

2.  **Compile the program:**
    ```bash
    gcc your_file_name.c -o your_file_name
    ```
    (Replace `your_file_name.c` with the actual file name, e.g., `APC-S-001.c`)

3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./your_file_name
    ```
    (Replace `your_file_name` with the name of the executable you just created.)
