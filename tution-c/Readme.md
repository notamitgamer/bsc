# `tution-c` Folder

This folder contains C programs written as part of my tuition classes. The file naming convention is designed to help me and anyone else easily identify the source of each program.

## File Naming Convention

Each C program file (`.c`) is prefixed to indicate its origin:

-   **`APC-S`**: Programs from Soumi Madam's class.

-   **`APC-SPS`**: Programs from SPS Sir's class.

-   **`APC-PRAC`**: Programs from the practical lab sessions.

-   **`P`**: Programs from my private tuition class (Eduincs).

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of these programs, you can use a C compiler like GCC.

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2.  **Navigate to the `tution-c` directory:**

    ```
    cd tution-c
    ```

3.  **Compile the program:**

    ```
    gcc filename.c -o filename.exe
    ```

    (Replace `filename.c` with the actual file name, e.g., `APC-S-001.c`)

4.  **Run the executable:**

    ```
    ./filename.exe
    ```

    (Replace `filename.exe` with the name of the executable you just created.)
