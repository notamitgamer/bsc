/*
 * A smart home security controller monitors the state of several sensors to decide what action to take.
 * Each second, the system reads data from sensors that are either an active or inactive. Based on the current
 * state of all sensors, the controller must perform exactly one action, such as activating a warning, checking
 * a specific zone, or declaring an intrusion. Write a C program that reads the sensor status as input and
 * prints the corresponding system action.
 * Hints:
 * 1. The most determinative action wins for every possible combination of sensor states.
 * 2. You are not allowed to use any conditional statements (if, else if, else, or the ternary operator?).
 * 3. You are not allowed to use logical operators.
 * 4. You must use a single switch statement to control the program's behavior.
 * 5. The program should handle all possible combinations of the sensors' active/inactive states and print the appropriate response each time.
 * 6. All sensors are inactive, the system should remain idle.
 * 7. If some sensors are active, the system should issue warnings or alerts based on the situation.
 * 8. If all sensors are active, the system should declare a confirmed intrusion.
 * Solution:
 * We can solve this problem simply by assigning each case its own distinct integer.
 * There are 2 possibilities for a sensor and therefore there are 2^4 = 16 cases.
 * Using arrays we can assign each case its own index value and print it as per the encoded binary integer.
