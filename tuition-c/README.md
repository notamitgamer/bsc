# C Programming Exercises: Tution Collection ðŸ“š

This repository contains a collection of C programs, organized by their source of origin from my tuition and lab classes. The aim is to create a clear and well-documented archive of all my work for easy reference.

## Project Overview

This folder serves as a centralized hub for all my C programming exercises. The files are meticulously named using a specific prefix to easily identify their source, as detailed in the section below.

## File Naming Convention

Each C source file (`.c`) follows a clear prefix system to indicate its origin. A quick glance at the filename tells you which class or lab session the code belongs to.

| Prefix | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`APC-S`** | Programs from class sessions with Soumi Madam. | Soumi Madam's Class |
| **`APC-SPS`** | Programs from class sessions with SPS Sir. | SPS Sir's Class |
| **`APC-PRAC`** | Programs completed during practical lab sessions. | Lab Practical |
| **`P`** | Programs from private tuition classes at Eduincs. | Eduincs (Private Tuition) |
