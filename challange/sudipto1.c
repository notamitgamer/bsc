/* A smart home security controller monitors the state of several sensors to decide what action to take.
 * Each second, the system reads data from sensors that can either be active or inactive. Based on the current
 * state of all sensors, the controller must perform exactly one action, such as activating a warning, checking
 * a specific zone, or declaring an intrusion. Write a C program that reads the sensor states as input and
 * prints the corresponding system action.
 -- Conditions:
    * 1. You must determine exactly one action for every possible combination of sensor states.
    * 2. You are not allowed to use any conditional statements (if, else if, else, or the ternary operator?).
    * 3. You are not allowed to use logical operators.
    * 4. You must use a single switch statement to control the program's behaviour.
    * 5. Loops may only be used for reading input, not for making decisions.
    * 6. The program should handle all possible combinations of the sensors' active/inactive states and print the appropriate response each time.
 -- Example (for understanding):
 * If all sensors are inactive, the system should remain idle.
 * If some sensors are active, the system should issue warnings or alerts based on the situation.
 * If all sensors are active, the system should declare a confirmed intrusion.
 */

/*
 * This program monitors the state of four sensors (Door, Window, Motion, Glass Break)
 * and determines the appropriate action without using any conditional (if, else)
 * or logical (&&, ||) operators.
 *
 * It works by combining the state of all sensors into a single integer value
 * using bitmasking. Each bit in the integer represents the state of one sensor
 * (1 for active, 0 for inactive). This combined state is then used in a single
 * switch statement to select the correct action for every possible combination.
 *
 * Then, enter the state of the four sensors separated by spaces,
 * for example: 1 0 1 0
