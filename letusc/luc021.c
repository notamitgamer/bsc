/* A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions:
    (i) Hardness must be greater than 50
    (ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7
    (iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600

The grades are as follows:
    Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met
    Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
    Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
    Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
    Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
    Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met

Write a program, which will require the user to give values of hardness,
carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output
the grade of the steel. */
