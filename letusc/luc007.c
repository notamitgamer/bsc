/* Wind-chill factor is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to wind.
The wind-chill temperature is always lower than the air temperature, and is
calculated as per the following formula.
    wcf = 35.74 + 0.6215t + (0.4275t - 35.75) * v^0.16
Where t is temperature and v is wind velocity. Write a program to receive
values of t and v and calcualate wind-chill factor (wcf). */
