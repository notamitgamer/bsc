/* Write a program for a matchstick game being played between the
computer and a user. Your program should ensure that the computer
always wins. Rules for the game are as follows :
    - There are 21 matchsticks.
    - The computer asks the player to pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 matchsticks.
    - After the person picks, the computer does its picking.
    - Whoever is forced to pick up the last matchstick loses the game.

/* Strategy: The total number of matchsticks is 21. To guarantee a win,
the computer ensures that after its turn, the number of remaining
matchsticks is always a multiple of 5 plus 1 (i.e., 16, 11, 6, 1).
This is achieved by making the sum of the player's pick and the
computer's pick equal to 5 in each round. This forces the player
to pick the final matchstick. */
