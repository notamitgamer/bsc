Click here to download the zip file directly from our server: (Direct Download Link)[https://aranag.site/download/MinGW64.zip]

#### Extract the archive:
Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the mingw64.zip file to a location on your computer. We recommend a simple path like C:\mingw64.

#### Add to your system's PATH:
To use the tools from any command prompt, you need to add the bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

Open the Start Menu and search for "Edit the system environment variables".

Click the `Environment Variables...` button.

In the `System variables` section, find the Path variable and click "Edit...".

Click `New` and add the path to the bin directory of your Mingw-w64 installation (e.g., C:\mingw64\bin).

Click `OK` on all windows to save the changes.

#### Verify the installation:
Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and type gcc --version. If the installation was successful, you should see the version information for the GCC compiler.
